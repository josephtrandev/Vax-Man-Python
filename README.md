# Vax-Man Python Game

> A game inspired by Pac-Man with a few different rules

# About Project:

To get a better understanding of PyGame and Python in general, this project will make use of the two to create a game called Vax-Man.

Vax-Man is inspired by Pac-Man, using the same rules with a few exceptions:

* Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
* Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
* Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
* The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.
